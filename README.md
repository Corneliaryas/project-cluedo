# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The website shows three cluedo card decks that display a random value when clicked, one deck with suspects, one with weapons and the last with rooms.
The point was to learn more about objects and arrays. Project made for technigo bootcamp. 

## The problem

I started with the given layout and focused on making the basic functionality work in JavaScript first. Then I went on to styling with CSS and HTML, controlling the styling a bit with JS, so that it changed when clicked. Next, I added the loading animation on the card decks, first a basic circular one, then one shaped like a magnifying glass that I made with div tags and CSS styling. After having the basics of both styling and functionality done I went back and forth between the two to add improvements.
